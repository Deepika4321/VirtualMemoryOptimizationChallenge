# VirtualMemoryOptimizationChallenge
# üß† Virtual Memory Optimization Challenge

An interactive educational simulator built with **Streamlit** to demonstrate **Page Replacement Algorithms** like **FIFO**, **LRU**, and **Optimal**. This project helps users understand how virtual memory works and visualize page faults over time.

## üìå Features

- Choose between FIFO, LRU, and Optimal page replacement algorithms
- Input memory reference string manually or by uploading a `.txt` file
- Visualize page table evolution step-by-step
- Graph showing page set size over time
- Simple, clean user interface with real-time feedback
